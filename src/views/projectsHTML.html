                <p>I was inspired to complete a project that not only took on the functionality of an existing site, but I wanted to prove that I could replicate it visually. I am confident in my abilities to create structure and design.</p>

                <p>I presented the idea of recreating a timeless classic Nintendo game for a group project at DevMountain. This was a fantastic experience working with others and seeing how different minds come together. I focused on project management ensuring
                    that everyone maintained their respective responsibilities as well as the positioning and scaling of nearly everything you see in this game. I presented the idea of working with PixiJS and after only three days of hands on experience
                    with the newly introduced rendering library, we were up and running with the beginning bits of a functioning game.</p>
